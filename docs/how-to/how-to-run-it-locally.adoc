= How to - Run it locally

== Install

First install some tools

----
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli
----

== Build

Build everything with the `yarn` tool

----
yarn build
----

== Run

Host the app locally on port 8888 (or any other port)

----
firebase serve
----

Easier to combine the two:

----
yarn build && firebase serve
----

You could also use `trunk serve` or other web servers but the advantage of using firebase to serve it locally is that
firebase then also ensures that the firebase imports (used for Firebase Authentication) work as well.

== Deploy

Deploy to firebase from your local command line

----
firebase deploy
----
