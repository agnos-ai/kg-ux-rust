= Do not use thedodd/trunk for builds

== Status

- [ ] Proposed
- [x] Accepted
- [ ] Rejected
- [ ] Deprecated
- [ ] Superseded

== Context

The build tool https://github.com/thedodd/trunk looks good and promising, ensures for a fast and lean and mean
distribution but is too limited:

- Does not load all the "bindgen" rust exports from the wasm.js file into Javascript space
-- uses 'import init from /index-<hash>.js' which only calls the default export function, not all the others
- Does not really work well together with npm modules (seems that this feature is coming though)

== Decision

Using the build approach as documented in the following repo:

- https://github.com/yewstack/yew-wasm-pack-template

== Consequences

- Slightly more complicated boilerplate and build process.
- Has the advantage of being able to combine the wasm-app with any other npm module.
- Has the advantage of being able to fully work with webpack.
