that describe an Architectural Decision (AD).

An Architectural Decision is a software design choice that addresses a functional
or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant.

An Architecturally Significant Requirement (ASR) is a requirement that has a
measurable effect on a software systemâ€™s architecture and quality.

An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures a single AD, such as often done when
writing personal notes or meeting minutes; the collection of ADRs created and
maintained in a project constitute its decision log.

All these are within the topic of Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM).
