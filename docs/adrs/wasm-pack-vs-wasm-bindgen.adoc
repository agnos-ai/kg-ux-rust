= wasm-pack vs wasm-bindgen

== Status

- [x] Proposed
- [ ] Accepted
- [ ] Rejected
- [ ] Deprecated
- [ ] Superseded

== Context

We need a utility that generates the right boilerplate to embed our
Rust app as a WASM binary in a webpage.

There are two main utilities for that:

1. wasm-pack
2. wasm-bindgen

Even though wasm-pack is recommended by the Rust team, it turns out
that it is more geared towards publishing a rust component as an npm package
whereas wasm-bindgen focuses on hosting a full app.
(According to the author of trunk: https://github.com/thedodd/trunk)

== Decision

Use `wasm-bindgen`

== Consequences

- The yew framework recommends `warm-pack` but still supports `wasm-bindgen`
- The `trunk` utility is based on `wasm-bindgen` so we can use that only
  if we stick to `wasm-bindgen`
