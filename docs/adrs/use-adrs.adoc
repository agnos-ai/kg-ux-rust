= Use ADRs

== Status

- [ ] Proposed
- [x] Accepted
- [ ] Rejected
- [ ] Deprecated
- [ ] Superseded

== Context

We need a way to record technical decisions made during development so that, 
in the future, people can find out why a decisions was made. 
This needs to be structured, lightweight and easy to find.

== Decision

Use ADRs and use this 
link:https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/blob/master/adr_template_by_michael_nygard.md[Michael Nygard's template], 
a copy of which is link:adr-template.adoc[here].

== Consequences

Future software developers and technical architects working on this codebase can
find out the reasons why someone made a particular decision, its context and 
consequences.

ADRs must be part of the delivery team's Definition of Done.
